/*
This is the meat and potatoes of this program, the candidate generation step (AKA search step).
Given a pattern string (and some other information) and a config struct,
will ultimately return a set of candidate solutions.
These candidates store just enough necessary to indicate a specific "match" in the FMindex's text
Such matches are prefix-suffix overlaps between the pattern and the match location strings,
in the code the pattern is often referred to as 'a' and the match is referred to as 'b'
Depending on the config, candidates will be generated according to reversals, edit distance, inclusions etc.

In the literature, often the patterns are solved by way of numerous SUFFIX FILTERS and solved with
forwards search. This concept of direction is dependent on the frame of reference in this implementation.
Due to the backwards search of the FMIndex, the text string used for the BWT is actually backwards.
For this reason, much of the search, iteration etc. are all backwards
(with respect to left -> right or ascending indexes).
Relative to the actual strings inside the text, and conceptually, the search is still forwards.
These two equally-correct perspectives cannot be resolved in all cases, so when possible I use
terms that are general in both directions. ie: FILTER instead of SUFFIX FILTER
